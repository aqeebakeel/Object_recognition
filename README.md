# Object_Recognition
This project focuses on real-time object detection and classification using machine learning and data analytics. The rover detects humans, classifies them as friendly or enemy, and takes actions based on gesture recognition. The dataset is simulated, stored in CSV format, and analyzed for system accuracy, performance, and improvements.

Future Work:
Increase Classification Accuracy
Train a Machine Learning model (CNN) for better enemy detection.
Optimize Response Time
Use real-time streaming data directly from SQL database instead of pre-processed CSV files.
Enhance Visualization & Reports
Implement a dashboard (Power BI) for real-time monitoring.
